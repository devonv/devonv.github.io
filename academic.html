             <h3>- Women's Center Manaul -</h3>
             <p>This is a receptionist manual I created during my internship with the Virginia Tech Women's Center. The original manual was a disorganized binder with papers and fact-sheets by many different authors, with no standard style. Part of my responsibility as an intern was to compile these sheets into a coherent manual with an index. I had to organize and rewrite most manual content.</p>
             <p>I was also responsible for the formatting choices. I chose a system of check-mark bullets and a clear page number system. Color and font choices were based on the Virginia Tech Women's Center style guide, and the finished binder is stylistically coherent with other Women's Center publications.</p>

         <h3>- SOP Proposal -</h3>
             <p>This is a proposal for a standard operating procedure project. Proposals are an important part of the technical writing and product development process. This proposal was for creation of a manual binder for the webmaster position in my community service organization. When I took over the position, there was no documentation or guiding document. The binder proposed in this document would include necessary information for new webmasters.</p>
             <p>This proposal is formatted according to conventional formatting stanadards, however I chose font styes myself. Sections in this propsal fit assignment criteria and address important aspects of proposal writing, like timeline and audience. </p>

          <h3>- Undergraduate Thesis -</h3>
             <p>This is an excerpt from my undergraduate thesis. It includes the introduction, background, and literature review. This document provides a brief introduction to the history of academic quilt documentation efforts and a review of literature that describes origins of certain documentation trends.</p>
             <p>This document is a good example of academic writing. It shows a range of subjects--from background information to literature analysis. I created this document as part of my undergraduate thesis, which deals with quilts in Virginia's New River Valley. </p>

         <h3>- Science Writing Paper -</h3>
             <p>This is a paper I wrote for a professional writing class called "Science Writing." This essay is meant to mimic popular writing on scientific studies. I chose the topic of GMO corn in Mexico because I was interested in writing about an issue with scientific and cultural significance. Corn in Mexico is a topic that transcends pure scientific discussion.</p>
             <p>This is a good example of a writing piece meant for a popular audience. The promt for this paper was to create a piece of science writing that would appeal to a wide audience.</p>
