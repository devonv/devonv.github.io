            <h2>A synthesis of my undergraduate experience...</h2>
            <p>I have had a very full undergraduate experience. I’ve participated in all the conventionally celebrated academic programs--internships, research, independent study--but I’ve also used this period of my life to have wonderfully complex, life changing experiences outside the classroom. My outside, creative life, and my more formal academic endeavors have always informed one another, and, in the course of my undergraduate career, they have come to beautifully meld. </p>

        <p>I came to college interested in learning about plants.  I originally planned to graduate with a degree in horticulture; however, I realized quickly that I was not a competent or dedicated chemistry student, and that I would only continue to struggle in upper level science classes, which I knew, would not hold my attention or provide the kind of challenge I was looking for. I came to the English department and happily found a home in the professional writing program doing the kinds of projects I had always enjoyed most in high school.</p>

<p>Professional writing is a blend of my two strengths:  writing and creativity in visual mediums. I am able, through my study in the professional writing program, to write clear, concise prose and to format it in a way that is intuitive and visually appealing. As a result of my professional writing coursework, I had an internship at the Virginia Tech Women’s Center that allowed me to use these skills; I created and maintained a blog and produced advertising materials for the Red Flag Campaign, and I also copy edited and reformatted Women’s Center documents. </p>

<p>My academic work has always been supplemented by outside interests in knitting, bookbinding, and gardening. Throughout the course of my undergraduate career, these “outside” interests have become integrated into my intellectual and scholarly goals. Since my initial switch into the English department, I have also regularly taken classes in women’s and gender studies and Appalachian studies, and I have come to see my interest in craft as a phenomena widespread and important--an area of investigation worthy of academic study. </p>

<p>My experience as an undergraduate will be defined by my senior honors thesis, which reflects my interest in both professional writing and folklore. I have spent the last year planning and executing a research project aimed at collecting data about quilts in the New River Valley, and my senior thesis project involves compiling this information into a database. Without my experience in the professional writing department, I would not be capable of compiling and synthesizing this data into a usable database and print documents. Without my interest in craft and folklore, I would not have been drawn to this important and unique craft phenomena in the New River Valley. </p>

<p>This final year of academic study has informed and directed my goals for the future. I now have a more-clear vision of how my scholarly interests in writing and communication, and my personal devotion to folk art can coexist. </p></div>
